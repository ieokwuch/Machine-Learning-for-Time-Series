# Machine-Learning-for-Time-Series
Time series modelling and analysis have typically been done in the past using statistical models such as ARIMA, SARIMA and GARCH. This project typically looks at solving time series problems using a host of machine learning techniques from traditional ones such as SVMs to complicated CNN-LSTMs.
